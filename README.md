# Event Watcher Desktop App Template
This should be used just like any other boilerplate template. I wanted to make my own since I feel most stuff out there was full off unnecessary fluff. 

## For development
The command `npm run electron:serve` is used.

## For building and packaging the app
Run `npm run electron:build` this will create an installer for the current OS. The installer will be found in `dist/*`.
